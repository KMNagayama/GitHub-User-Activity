# 🧠 GitHub Activity CLI

A simple **command-line tool** built with **C# (.NET 6)** that fetches and displays the recent **public activity of any GitHub user** — including commits, stars, issues, and more — using the **GitHub REST API**.

This project was created as part of the [roadmap.sh CLI project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity), to practice working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building command-line applications in C#.
